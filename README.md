InfoTech Academy - an learning meets innovation! We believe learning should be exciting, practical, and future-ready. Our system, InfoTech, built for students who have difficulties on finding some academic studies about their specific subject, or just want to have an advance knowledge about the subject they are going to take. This system helps them to be more knowledgeable and gives them easy access to the subject they want to learn, they can also take quizzes in our system to help them boost their knowledge and have more fun practices.

This project is only a final project for our courses, ITEC50. For educational purposes only.
